NODEACTYL DOES NOT YET FULLY SUPPORT V1

The nodeactyl code for pterodactyl v1 has been released in a seperate library called `nodeactyl-beta` while the final changes are made before final release. The docs have not yet been updated to reflect the changes made in v1, so to use, you will either need to look through the library code or ask for assistance in the discord.

For updates regarding the v1 update, join the discord below and run `?rank Panel v1 Update` in `#bot-commands`
{% endhint %}
